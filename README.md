## Introduction
Eclipses are celestial events that have captured the curiosity of humans for centuries. This project aims to provide insights into the science behind eclipses and answer common questions about their occurrence, alignment, prediction, and more.

## Key Questions
Throughout this project, we address several key questions related to eclipses:
1. *How do eclipses occur?*
2. *Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?*
3. *What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?*
4. *How often do eclipses occur?*
5. *How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?*
6. *What is the difference between a lunar and solar eclipse?*
7. *What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months (or twice a year)?*

## Project Description
We have developed a solution to address the questions mentioned above. Additionally, we have created a simulation that demonstrates the type of eclipse that occurs at a specific point when the Earth and Moon are positioned on their solar orbits. Our project includes two interactive activities:

1. *Eclipse Type Prediction:* Given specific angles and positions, our tool predicts the type of eclipse (solar or lunar) that will occur.

2. *Eclipse Simulation:* Our simulation allows users to visualize both solar and lunar eclipses in a realistic and educational manner.

## Features
- Detailed explanations and answers to common questions about eclipses.
- Interactive eclipse type prediction activity.
- Realistic eclipse simulation with Earth and Moon on solar orbits.
